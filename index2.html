            <P>Kendall Nicole Jenner (born November 3, 1995)[3] is an American model, media personality, socialite and businesswoman. She is a daughter of Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner, and rose to fame in the reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, in which she starred for 20 seasons and nearly 15 years from 2007 to 2021. The success of the show led to the creation of multiple spin-off series including Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami (2009), Kourtney and Kim Take New York (2011), Khloe & Lamar (2011), Rob & Chyna (2016) and Life of Kylie (2017).

            <h2 class="black-text"> Coco Chanel</h2>
            <p>Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel (/ʃəˈnɛl/ shə-NEL, French: [ɡabʁijɛl bɔnœʁ kɔko ʃanɛl] ⓘ; 19 August 1883 – 10 January 1971)[2] was a French fashion designer and businesswoman. The founder and namesake of the Chanel brand, she was credited in the post–World War I era with popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style. This replaced the "corseted silhouette" that had earlier been dominant with a style that was simpler, far less time-consuming to put on and remove, more comfortable, and less expensive, all without sacrificing elegance. She is the only fashion designer listed on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.[3] A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing, realizing her aesthetic design in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product, and Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.<p></div>

            <P>Scientists can’t quite agree when we (humans) started wearing clothes. It may have been 33,000 years ago or even as long as 170,000 years ago. It’s impossible to tell who first came up with the idea of putting on leather or fur to keep warm, evade disease, camouflage themselves or even a attract a partner. Perhaps there existed a virtuoso ‘fashion designer’ in early humanity, the first person ever to craft a garment – sadly, the identity of this creative person is destined to remain a mystery, forever hidden deep in human history.</P>
